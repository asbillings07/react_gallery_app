### React_Gallery_App

## About this project

This project allows users to search for their favorite pictures via the Flickr API. It includes three premade link choices for them to see the different pictures that come up.

If no results are found, the user will be meet with a `No Results Found` page that will tell them to search again.

If the user happens to stumble on to a page that does not exist, they will see a `404 - Not Found` page that tells them the page does not exist and to press one of the button links above to navigate back to safety.

## Motivation and Changes to this project

This project was created as a part of a Techdegree program at TreeHouse.

`Changes Made`:

- CSS styles were changed to give effects to button links
- Background color was changed to give a more personal feel
- Boarder shadow was added to give the appearance of floating icons

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
